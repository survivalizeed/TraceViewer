**Inspect, Analyze, and Deobfuscate x64dbg Trace Files with Ease.**

Trace Viewer is a powerful and user-friendly tool, developed using C#, designed to help you effectively examine and understand trace files generated by the x64dbg debugger. Whether you're reverse-engineering malware, analyzing complex software, virtualized code, or simply trying to understand program execution flow, this viewer provides the features you need to gain valuable insights.

## Features

* **Intuitive Interface:** A clean and organized interface for easy navigation through trace data.
* **Detailed Trace Information:** View detailed information for each trace record, including:
    * Instruction address
    * Executed instruction (with operands)
    * Register values (configurable display)
    * Memory access information (read/write addresses and values)
    * Timestamp of execution
* **Powerful Filtering:** Filter trace records based on various criteria such as:
    * Instruction address range
    * Specific instructions or mnemonics
    * Register values
    * Memory access patterns
* **Advanced Search:** Search for specific instructions, addresses, register values, or memory content within the trace.
* **Deobfuscation Capabilities:** (Depending on the implementation) Features to aid in deobfuscating traced code, such as:
    * Identifying and highlighting common obfuscation techniques.
    * Basic script execution or analysis for deobfuscation (if implemented).
    * Customizable rule-based deobfuscation (if implemented).
* **Data Visualization:** (Future potential) Visual representations of the trace data to identify patterns and anomalies.
* **Export Functionality:** Export filtered or analyzed trace data to various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for further processing or reporting.
* **Performance Optimized:** Designed to handle large trace files efficiently thanks to the power of C#.
* **Windows Compatibility:** Primarily designed for Windows due to its integration with x64dbg trace files. (Specify if other platforms are supported or planned).

## Installation

Provide clear and concise instructions on how to install and run the Trace Viewer.

**Option 1: Using Pre-built Binaries (Recommended for most users)**

1.  Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/survivalizeed/trace-viewer/releases) page.
2.  Download the latest stable release ZIP file.
3.  Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
4.  Run the executable file (`TraceViewer.exe`).

## Usage

Explain how to use the Trace Viewer with clear steps and examples.

1.  **Loading a Trace File:**
    * Open the Trace Viewer application (`TraceViewer.exe`).
    * Navigate to the "File" menu and select "Open Trace File".
    * Browse to the location of your x64dbg trace file (`.log` or `.txt` depending on x64dbg settings) and select it.
    * The trace data will be loaded and displayed in the main view.

2.  **Navigating the Trace:**
    * Use the scroll bar or arrow keys to move through the trace records.
    * The main table will display the key information for each step.

3.  **Filtering Trace Data:**
    * Locate the "Filter" panel (the exact location may vary depending on your UI).
    * Specify your filtering criteria (e.g., address range `0x401000-0x401FFF`, instruction `CALL`, register `EAX == 0`).
    * Click the "Apply Filter" button.
    * Only the trace records that match your criteria will be displayed.
    * You can clear the filter to view all records again.

4.  **Searching the Trace:**
    * Go to the "Edit" menu or look for a search bar.
    * Enter your search term (e.g., `mov eax`, `0x77000000`, `[esp+4]`).
    * Click "Find Next" or "Search".
    * The viewer will highlight the first matching record.

5.  **Using Deobfuscation Features (If Implemented):**
    * Refer to the specific documentation or UI elements related to deobfuscation within the application.
    * This might involve selecting specific options, providing scripts, or configuring rules.

6.  **Exporting Data:**
    * Navigate to the "File" menu and select "Export".
    * Choose your desired export format (e.g., "CSV", "JSON").
    * Specify the output file location and click "Save".
